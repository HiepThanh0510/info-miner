In this paper several time series abstraction methods are reviewed with respect to their applicability in the framework of knowledge discovery (KDD) and data mining (DM). We discuss the demands of KDD/DM (noise, robustness) and show many widely used methods do not satisfy them, because they are single-scale methods. With multiscale approaches, however, the drawbacks of the single-scale methods can be addressed explicitly. In knowledge discovery from time series the goal is to detect interest- ing patterns in the series that may help a human to better recognize the regularities in the observed variables and thereby improve the understanding of the system. Computer programs are very good in number crunching, but knowledge arises only in the head of a hu- man. Ideally, knowledge discovery algorithms therefore use time se- ries representations that are close to those that are used by a human. If a human is interested in gaining insight in some time series data not tabular but graphical representations are used. The impressive pattern recognition capabilities of the human brain help to establish connections between different time series or different parts of a sin- gle time series on the basis of their visual appearance. This is a rea- sonable approach, not only because humans are very good in visual pattern recognition, but also because (changing) trends in the output variables reflect (changes in) the internal state of system. Many machine learning algorithms (like decision trees), however, have been designed to work with numerical feature vectors. Using subsampling such methods can be applied to time series data to in- duce classification trees, however, the results obtained from such an approach are usually not easily accessible by a human because the tabular representation of a time series rather than the visual percep- tion of its profile is addressed. Besides that, frequently observed ef- fects like translation and dilation cannot be handled by such an approach.
